# Boys State Agenda Bot – Calendar System Requirements

## Purpose

A Discord bot system to manage and broadcast agenda information for the New Mexico Boys State program. The bot integrates with Google Calendar to:

* Send reminders to participants about upcoming events
* Notify participants when the calendar changes (new, updated, or cancelled events)
* Allow participants to list events for today or future dates

---

## Existing Functionality (Baseline)

The bot already includes the following implemented features:

✅ `/calendar` main command with subcommands:

* `/calendar set` → Adds a Google Calendar ID (with optional label) for the guild.
* `/calendar edit` → Edits the label of an existing calendar.
* `/calendar remove` → Removes a calendar from the guild.
* `/calendar list` → Lists calendars configured for the guild.

✅ Permissions enforced:

* Only users with `Administrator` permissions can run these commands.

✅ Modular command structure using `SlashCommandBuilder` and handlers in `commands/calendar/` directory.

✅ Database already exists (or assumed) for storing configured calendars.

✅ Design allows for multiple calendars per guild.

---

## Additional Requirements

### 1. Google Calendar Integration

* Periodically query Google Calendar API (e.g., every 5 minutes) for each configured calendar.
* Always fetch live data from API for sync.
* Support syncing one or more Google Calendar IDs per guild (already implemented).

### 2. Database for Diff Tracking

* Use existing database as a snapshot store for the last known state of synced events.
* Compare API results with stored data to detect changes:

  * New event → send "Added" notification
  * Updated event → send "Updated" notification
  * Deleted event → send "Cancelled" notification
* Update database after each sync to reflect current state.

### 3. Change Notifications

* Post notifications in a **designated notification channel** per guild when changes are detected.

### 4. Reminders

* Send reminder messages **X minutes before event starts** (reminder window configurable per guild).
* Post reminders in the **configured notification channel**.
* Use API data for reminders (fallback to DB if API unavailable).

### 5. Listing Events

* `/calendar list [today|tomorrow|YYYY-MM-DD]` → lists events for specified day.
* Uses live API data if available; falls back to DB if API fails.
* Output as embed with event name, start time, location.

## Administrative Configuration

The following admin commands already exist and will be extended:

| Command                                    | Description                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `/calendar set <calendar_id> [label]`      | Add a calendar ID for this guild |
| `/calendar edit <calendar_id> [new_label]` | Edit calendar label              |
| `/calendar remove <calendar_id>`           | Remove a calendar                |
| `/calendar list`                           | List configured calendars        |

New admin commands to add:

| Command                            | Description                                    |               |                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `/calendar set-channel <#channel>` | Set notification/reminder channel              |               |                                 |
| `/calendar set-reminder <minutes>` | Set reminder window (lead time)                |               |                                 |
| `/calendar sync`                   | Manually trigger calendar sync + notifications |               |                                 |
| \`/calendar events \[today         | tomorrow                                       | YYYY-MM-DD]\` | List events for a specific date |

---

## System Behavior

✅ Existing calendar management commands remain unchanged.
✅ Notification channel & reminder window will be per-guild settings stored in DB.
✅ Change notifications generated from API-to-DB diff.
✅ Always prioritize API data; DB serves only for diff tracking and fallback.
✅ No per-user subscriptions, no role mentions, no DMs.

---

## Summary

The bot is already capable of managing configured calendars at the guild level.
This updated specification extends functionality to automate:

* Event syncing from Google Calendar
* Change notifications
* Scheduled reminders
* Listing events

All while preserving existing features and command structure.
